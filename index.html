    <h1>What are Vegetables?</h1>
    <p>the fresh edible portions of certain herbaceous plantsâ€”roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruit, or seeds. These plant parts are either eaten fresh or prepared in a number of ways, usually as a savory, rather than sweet, dish. Vegetables may be washed, sorted, graded, cut, and packaged for sale as fresh products. Fresh vegetables are subject to quick aging and spoilage, but their storage life can be extended by such preservation processes as dehydration, canning, freezing, fermenting, or pickling.</p>

    <h1> What constitutes a fruit?</h1>
    <p>Botanically, a fruit is a mature ovary and its associated parts. It usually contains seeds, which have developed from the enclosed ovule after fertilization, although development without fertilization, called parthenocarpy, is known, for example, in bananas. Fertilization induces various changes in a flower: the anthers and stigma wither, the petals drop off, and the sepals may be shed or undergo modifications; the ovary enlarges, and the ovules develop into seeds, each containing an embryo plant. The principal purpose of the fruit is the protection and dissemination of the seed. </p>

    <h1>Notable #3: Peas in a Pod</h1>
    <p>Peas often grow on a vine supported by a pole. Green peas are sometimes called sweet peas or English pease. Peas are actually classified as a fruit, though most people refer to them as vegetables.</p>
